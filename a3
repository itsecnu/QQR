Input M= question bank
     q= planning horizon
zs= number of question for question preference initialization
zt= number of question for transition preference initialization
nbinss= number of percentile bin descriptors per question feature
nbinst=number of percentile bin descriptors per transition feature
B: percent of top questions to use during planning
	Obtain GCN-LSTM based engagement prediction
	Initialization of question weightsφs and transition weightsφt (with M,zs,zt,,nbinss,nbinst)
	k=0
	While user requesting another question do:
	      k=k+1
	      Select the next question: xk: Run Algorithm2 (with M,q,R, current question playing question0 ←xk, B)
	      Obtain question score and engagement trend after xk: reward vk, and average reward thus far (v_k ) ̅.
	      Update reward model R’; s parameters: φs, φt ←Run Algorithm 1(with xk, k, vk, (v_k ) ̅, φs, φt)
End while
